        <p>Hi! On this page you will find a playable window of my Final project for my CSC 106 class along with a video of me explaiing the code.<br>
            For the project, my partner and I chose to create a simplified version of Blackjack. The game includes a splash screen with a Start button <br>
            that will bring you to the game and a How To button that will bring you to an instruction screen on how to play the game. In the game <br>
            the player and dealer are dealt their first cards just like how a normal game would. The player than has the option to continue to "Hit" <br>
            in order to add more cards to their hand or choose "Stand" which will end their turn and allow the dealer to hit based on the player score <br>
            and how close they are to 21. Whoever is closest to 21 without going over wins!
