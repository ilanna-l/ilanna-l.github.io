    <p id="first-p">Hi, my name is Ilanna Langton and I am currently a first year student here at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring <br>
       in computer science and hoping to pick up a minor however, I am still deciding in what way I would like to focus my education.<br>
       Throughout my highschool career I was introduced to multiple areas of study within the large umbrella that is computer science. <br>
       From these courses I have gained breif experiance in the following...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Desgin: HTML/CSS (my favorite and what sparked my interest in comp sci)</li>
            <li>Graphic Design: Adobe Photoshop</li>
            <li>Python:website and program design</li>
        </ul>
    <p>I can't wait to dive deeper into these areas as well as explore new topics like data science, cyber security, and more. As of right<br>
       now I don't have a specific comp sci career path in mind and hope to try new things and create a well rounded portfolio before deciding.
