    <p id="first-p">Hi, my name is Ilanna Langton and I am currently a first year student here at the <br>
       University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in computer science and hoping to pick up a minor however,<br>
       I am still deciding in what way I would like to focus my education. Throughout my highschool career <br>
       I was introduced to multiple areas of study within the large umbrella that is computer science. <br>
       From these courses I have gained breif experiance in<br>
       -Web Desgin: HTML/CSS (my favorite and what sparked my interest in comp sci),<br>
       -Graphic Design: Adobe Photoshop<br>
       -Python:website and program design.<br>
       I can't wait to dive deeper into these areas as well as explore new topics like data science, cyber security,<br>
       and more. As of right now I don't have a specific comp sci career path in mind and hope to try new <br>
       things and create a well rounded portfolio before deciding.
