    <p>Hi, my name is Ilanna Langton and I am currently a first year student here at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring <br>
       in computer science and hoping to pick up a minor however, I am still deciding in what way I would like to expand my education.<br>
       Throughout my highschool career I was introduced to multiple areas of study within the large umbrella that is computer science. <br>
       From these courses I have gained breif experiance in the following...
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Web Desgin: HTML/CSS (my favorite and what sparked my interest in comp sci)</li>
        <li>Graphic Design: Adobe Photoshop</li>
        <li>Python:website and program design</li>
    </ul>
